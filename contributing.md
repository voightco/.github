Contributions to this project are [released](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/#6-contributions-under-repository-license) to the public under the project's open source license.

Please note that this project is released with a Contributor Code of Conduct. By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Contribute

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

- Follow the standards for style and code quality usually enforced trough linters in the repository.
- Commit early and often and write descriptive commit messages.

Code is not the only thing you can contribute. Fixing typo's, writing documentation, sharing your opinion are all very helpful!

## Issues

Before opening a new issue, look for existing issues (even closed ones). If you're reporting a bug, include as much information as possible. Some repo's use template issues to help you describe your bug.

## Pull requests

Don't open a pull request if you don't plan to see it through. Make sure a pull request has very specific functionality; if the changes are large or breaking it will take more time to review and merge. 

Make the pull request from a new branch not the main default one. Give the pull request a clear title and description. 

Have fun! üéâ
