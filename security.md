# Security

> **Note**: I'm no security expert. I'm constantly learning about this topic so this policy is a work in progress.

If you believe youâ€™ve found a security issue in any software, service, or website governed by voightco, we encourage you to notify us.

Please report (suspected) security vulnerabilities in the [issue tracker][issue] of that repository. If the issue is confirmed, we will release a patch as soon
as possible depending on complexity.

Please include the following details:
- the website, page or code where the vulnerability can be observed

You can also report a security issue directly by sending an email to hi@dandevri.es.
